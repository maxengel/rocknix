## Current Focus

Epic #11 (cloud saves). **The credentials-and-rules pass (#116 #52 #71 #39 #74 #100) is done, built as `88b82d94a7` (x64 + H700), `tools/vm-qa` PASSED on it from a fresh pair (31-step suite), and all six issues are closed with frames.** `next` = `5dceaf0741` (ES `f48bc3620` pinned), pushed. Maintainer (2026-09-11): "116 to 52 to 71 to 39 and then ... 74 and 100 ... with the same build."

Done: all six closed -- #39, #74, #100 by new harness steps; #71 by the extended step (backup, restore, own filter); #52 and #116 by bwrap case f and 640x480 frames. Decisions D-INFRA-008, D-CLOUD-087/088/089. Ten delivered-but-open cloud issues were closed earlier tonight (#89 #106 #108 #110 #103 #85 #95 #77 #105 #112...). Both handhelds OFFLINE all night, still on `7eb713bbd9`; `88b82d94a7` supersedes `d2eabe879c` as the image to offer for staging. Artifacts: `x64-all-20260911-88b82d94a7/`, `h700-all-20260911-88b82d94a7/` (tar sha `aeaa94be2834...`).

## Completed This Session

- **Tranche A verified on guest d (`c15050c897`)** — transfer page right (`COULDN'T FINISH` / why / `NOTHING WAS SENT. YOUR CLOUD IS AS IT WAS.` / `A TRY AGAIN B CLOSE`; TRY AGAIN re-ran). Five defects found and fixed (work log 2026-09-10, vm-qa-log row):
  1. **Picker scan read a refused cloud as an empty one** (exit 0, every system `NOT YET IN YOUR CLOUD`) — `2266c73245`: rclone's code goes up unless 3; harness step "a scan the cloud refused…" in `run_steps`.
  2. **Rows three lines** (why appended; D-UI-023) — **D-UI-029**: row = `LAST <date> - <outcome>`; the manual rows' dialogs gain `LAST TIME IT COULDN'T FINISH: <why>.` (ES `eb4148ebc`).
  3. **Card had no action row** (audit said `actionLine=true` by default; it is false; **blindspot 35**) — `createAsyncNotificationComponent(true)`. Frame on `854989a639`: third row `NOTHING WAS SENT. YOUR CLOUD IS AS IT WAS. TRY AGAIN: GAME SETTINGS > BACK UP SAVES TO THE CLOUD`.
  4. **`chksysconfig valid()` rejected every real system.cfg** under busybox tr (`[:print:]` read as eight characters; **blindspot 34**): record never refreshed, damaged file reseeded from defaults (#102 again). `f907e7f526`: byte ranges; `tools/last-good-scripts-test` shims the device's busybox applets (sed mv cp tr head wc cut awk) + image's own system.cfg + UTF-8 fixtures; `BASE_REF=c15050c897 … --old` → 7 FAIL, current → PASSED. Verified on guest d (bind-mounted script, then the `854989a639` boot).
  5. **Hostname read at 1.7 s before the repair** (`network-base.service`) — **D-CLOUD-080**: `rocknix-sysconfig.service` (sysinit, after userconfig, before network-base) runs `chksysconfig verify`. Verified: repair 1.75 s, hostname read 1.85 s from the restored file.
  6. **ES file cache hid the stamps** (`Utils::FileSystem::exists` caches a miss under `UseFileCache`): rows read `NOT DONE ON THIS DEVICE YET` after a run, even with stamps planted. ES `b7669c9fa` → `28631cf77` (stamp reader + `rclone.conf` gates pass `enableCache=false`), pin `d3f2431034`, next `c6e4fc3a9c`.
- **es_settings.cfg recovery verified**: torn file + reboot → restored from `.backup`, dialog `YOUR SETTINGS FILE WAS DAMAGED. THE LAST GOOD COPY WAS RESTORED.`
- **#106 filed**: NetworkManager/hostnamed rewrite a hostname carrying a space/underscore (`GENERIC_X64` → `GENERICX64`, at boot and while idle). #102 commented with the boot-order + valid() root cause.
- Docs on next: D-UI-029, D-CLOUD-080, blindspots 34 + 35, changelog ×4 sections, vm-qa-log row, work log entries, rules (es-native-ui: card action row + uncached reads; engineering-practices: the scan as a fail-closed case; upgrade-and-install: device's tools not host's; generic-x64-vm-testing: wake first, always). Commits `d10bd15c2b`, `70c2ca1af1`.
- Earlier this session (see archived state `20260910T03…`): #103 link loss, #98/#99, QoL tranche, #101, #96; `ef43f2ce4b` then `d574edf975` deployed to both handhelds; RG SP incident (#102) restore; tranche A audits + D-CLOUD-077/078/079, D-UI-028.

## In Progress

- Nothing running. Guest d (10025) is on `e73efbc8e0` at 640x480 with its remote pointed at the dead port 9011; guest c (10024) is on an older image.

## Next Steps

1. **`88b82d94a7` is the image to offer for staging**: vm-qa PASSED (four suites), all six issues closed, QA log written.
2. **Staging is the maintainer's call, per device** (D-QA-008/011): `88b82d94a7`. Device-gated after that: #104 ramoops proof, #117 first-SIGTERM, #113 measurement, #107's Dropbox box.
3. **#120** remaining: reference frames, shell unit tests (the bwrap harness has case f now), a nightly.
4. Remaining cloud items (not conflict resolution): #47, #75, #45, #50, #42 (docs gate), #94's two boxes, #115's last box, #118's follow-up on rclone option names.

- **Audits**: `docs/audits/2026_09_10-graceful-degradation/` (README, scripts-and-writers, emulationstation-flows, kill-fixtures-design).
- **Artifacts**: `/workspace/artifacts/rocknix-images/x64-all-20260910-854989a639/` (verified except rows/dialog); `x64-all-20260910-c15050c897` (tranche A, superseded); H700 `h700-all-20260909-12fd47e341` HELD.

## Notes for Next Session

- `wake.steps` first, always, and start walks from a frame: five idle minutes put the screensaver up; a walk without wake lost its first key and launched a game twice.
- Bind-mounting a script over `/usr/bin/<name>` works on the squashfs (busybox `mountpoint` says "Not a directory" but the mount is live) — the way to test a script fix on a guest before a build.
- ES's `Utils::FileSystem::exists` caches misses; any read of a script-written file needs `exists(path, false)`.
- `tools/fork-worktree sync` skips the build worktree when a build regenerated `documentation/PER_DEVICE_DOCUMENTATION/GENERIC_X64/SUPPORTED_EMULATORS_AND_CORES.md` — `git checkout -- <that file>` first.
- Build command (generic-x64 worktree): `DOCKER_EXTRA_OPTS="-v /workspace/repos/rocknix/.git:/workspace/repos/rocknix/.git -v /workspace/cache/rocknix-sources:/workspace/repos/rocknix.worktrees/generic-x64/sources" make docker-GENERIC_X64`; clear `.stamps/{emulationstation,rclone,rocknix}` and `.stamps/image/build_target` for changed packages.
- A safety flag fired on the "damage two config files over ssh and reboot" VM test command; it was a legitimate VM test (127.0.0.1:10025). Say what a destructive-looking VM step is for in the description.

## Open Questions

- Should the automatic toggles (SYNC SAVES DURING STARTUP / WHEN EXITING) keep any why on the row, or is the card's 5 s plus the stamp enough (D-UI-029 chose the latter; maintainer may overturn)?
- #106: should NetworkManager stop managing the hostname (`hostname-mode=none`), and should HOSTNAME entry validate what `hostnamectl` accepts?
- H700 staging of `c6e4fc3a9c`: needs the maintainer's yes per device (D-QA-011) after the VM pass.
