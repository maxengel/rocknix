# Saved Session State

> **Saved**: 2026-09-06T18:29:34Z
> **Branch**: feature/conflict-resolution (worktree; the work itself landed on `next`)
> **Repo**: maxengel/rocknix (+ ES at ~/Development/emulationstation-next, branch feature/cloud-vocabulary → test/qa-integration)

## Current Focus

The intermediary work is delivered: #76 and #77 are on both handhelds (`0803aa195c`), every acceptance criterion ticked on observed behaviour; both issues stay open only for the maintainer's look at the screens. The VM and the QA backend are down. Next is the switch to the conflict-resolution milestone: `begin-delivery` on #11, starting at Gate 0 (#35).

## Completed This Session

- #76 scripts: `--with-media`, `MEDIA_DIRS`/`MEDIA_EXCLUDES` on both `rclone copy` calls, `cloud_content_restore --scan` (union of both sides, six fields, awk `not_in` instead of `comm`). Commits on `next`: `b8773f2224`, `93621cfdbc`, the excludes fix, and ES bumps `744a19e3af`/later to ES `5dd7f7f04`.
- #76 interface (ES `6ce655b32`, `5dd7f7f04`): direction-aware picker, SCRAPED GAME CONTENT switch (`cloudsync.content.media`), entry rows on both transfer pages, hub row removed, `cloudMediaFlag()` on both transfer commands.
- VM run (four GENERIC_X64 images) found and fixed: busybox has no `comm`; `MEDIA_EXCLUDES` unused (blindspot 30); three-line switch row. Criteria 2–6 ticked on #76 from screendumps and the backend's directory.
- Docs on `next` (`d07fe2951a`): changelog "Scraped game content is a switch", blindspot 30, rclone rule paragraph (content flags; what busybox lacks), work log 06:56.
- H700 image `2b2a8d385f` kept at `/workspace/artifacts/rocknix-images/h700-content76-20260906-2b2a8d385f…/` (tar sha256 `7d56feb4…`); staged in the RG35XX SP's `~/.update` after on-device checksum. RG SP: nothing staged — it was running Mario Tennis.

## In Progress

- Nothing in flight. #76/#77 close on the maintainer's word after the screen look (close `completed` naming `0803aa195c`, ES `1fff9e904`).

## Next Steps

1. `begin-delivery` on #11: prior "retro" = the council handoff (Step 6, `research/council-runs/2026-09-05-conflict-resolution-foundation/`); futro against #35 and #9 with blindspots 29 and 30 in hand; load Gate 0's tasks (#35: the round-trip harness in the VM, every fixture written to fail first — `tools/cloud-round-trip` over SSH, or `tools/vm-serial` now that it exists).
2. Gate 11 (#9 bisync spike → settles D-CLOUD-044), Gate 12 (writer census for #21/#22).
3. Carried debt: rocknix.org docs PR (hard gate before any upstream PR; the changelog sections are the draft); #73's remaining on-screen review; a rebuild at some point for the `--scan` BIOS tidy-up (`next` only).

## Related Context

- **Tracker**: #76 (journey milestone, `cloud-saves`), D-CLOUD-048/043, D-UI-023, D-QA-007/008; epic #11 handed off (Step 6) earlier this session.
- **Council run**: `research/council-runs/2026-09-05-conflict-resolution-foundation/` (complete).
- **VM**: headless recipe in `generic-x64-vm-testing.md` + CLAUDE.md; helpers in the session scratchpad (`serialsh.py`, `ppm2png.py`, step files); QEMU pidfile `qemu76.pid`; sockets `/tmp/claude-1000/{m76,s76}.sock`; backend `tools/cloud-test-backend` (WebDAV, `~/.cache/rocknix-cloud-qa/data`).

## Notes for Next Session

- Driving ES over the QEMU monitor: `up` from a page's first row lands on the BACK button (three `up`s from the top of GAME SETTINGS to MANAGE CLOUD STORAGE); START on MAIN MENU closes it; after five idle minutes the first key only wakes the screensaver (send `shift`); keys: start=ret, A=x, B=z.
- `pkill -f` with a bracketed pattern still kills the shell whose command text holds the literal elsewhere — kill by pidfile.
- Busybox on the image: no `comm`, `pgrep -c`, `find -printf`, `ls --time-style`.
- After a compaction, grep for any code-state claim in the summary before building on it (blindspot 30; memory `verify-summary-claims-by-grep`).

## Open Questions

- Close #76/#77 now, or after the maintainer's screen look?
- D-CLOUD-044 (bisync-gap posture) stays parked until the #9 spike.
