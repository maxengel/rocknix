# Council — round 3, peer vote

You are one of five council members. Each of you has now produced a round-3
revised approach to the foundation for cloud-save conflict resolution in
ROCKNIX. The corpus is embedded above, unchanged and hash-verified; the other
four members' round-3 revised plans are injected below.

Vote for **exactly one** of them. You may not vote for your own plan, and your
own plan is not injected — judge the four you are given.

## Anti-self-citation constraint

Judge the plans on their merits against the embedded corpus. Do not treat the
injected artifacts as evidence about how councils, models, or this deliberation
behave.

## Amendment to the problem context — two maintainer decisions

Both are authoritative, both were made **after** the injected plans were
written, and neither is open for argument. No plan is expected to name them and
none should be criticised for their absence. What matters is which plans are
closest to them, and what each would have to change.

### The purpose, restated

> also something a user should have the option to do. They likely aren't going
> to be going 8 steps back with the save, but may accidentally make the wrong
> choice with the conflict and want to undo that choice. That's going to be the
> primary use case.

So: reversibility is a first-class requirement, the depth that matters is one
step back rather than a version history, and an edge case may inform a design
but may not drive it. In particular, the argument that a capability must be
given up *because* a detached or unmounted card is indistinguishable from a
deliberate deletion is not on its own sufficient. Failing closed on an
unexplained absence is cheap and is still expected; abandoning a capability to
buy it needs a better reason than the edge case alone.

### Where the undo lives, and where it does not

The plans divided on whether version one ships a control the player can press.
The maintainer has settled it:

> I don't want to add more complexity to the user during conflict resolution.
> The goal there is to get the user going as quickly as possible.

**Version one retains the discarded copy, on by default, bounded by a count, and
ships no undo control.** The wizard's done page says what was discarded and that
the copies are kept. Nothing in the resolution flow offers to put one back. A
plan that makes an on-device undo surface a version-one requirement is now
over-scoped, and a plan that builds lineage or receipt machinery deeper than one
step back is solving a problem the maintainer has said is not the primary case.

Restoring a discarded copy becomes a **separate tool**, tracked as its own
issue, and the maintainer has given it a shape:

> an option that allows you to essentially go back through conflict resolution
> flow and use it as a history restore flow, almost like a time machine, to
> overwrite the existing save with something from the past

That is the wizard's own compare-and-choose surface, pointed at a game's
retained past versions instead of at a live conflict, reached from outside the
moment of resolution.

**One consequence lands inside version one even though the tool does not.**
Nothing reads the discard store in version one, so nothing will catch a store
shape that a later reader cannot drive a picker from — one keyed only by a
timestamp, or one that drops which game, which slot, which device produced the
copy, and which side won. The store is designed now for a reader that does not
exist yet. Say whether each plan's retention design survives that requirement.

## What you are voting for

The winning plan becomes the foundation the maintainer builds on. So vote for
the plan that would be **safest and most buildable if adopted as written**, not
the one that is most impressive or most thorough. Weigh, in this order:

1. **Does it protect player progress, and is a wrong outcome recoverable?** The
   cardinal rule is that no save is lost and that resolution never defaults to
   recency. A plan with an elegant architecture and one silent-overwrite path is
   worse than a plainer plan with none. Recoverable means the discarded bytes are
   retained by default and recorded richly enough for the separate restore tool
   to drive a picker from them later. It does **not** mean a control in version
   one: a plan that ships an undo surface in the resolution flow is over-scoped
   against the amendment, not ahead of it.
2. **Is it grounded?** Claims about the shipped code, EmulationStation's
   helpers, rclone's behaviour and the register's decisions should be correct,
   and hypotheses should be labelled as hypotheses with an experiment named.
3. **Is it actually implementable** by a small team on a busybox handheld,
   inside the stated budgets, against 69 rclone backends of varying capability?
4. **Does it sequence the work** so the cheap experiments that could invalidate
   a design run before the expensive building?
5. **Is it honest about what it does not know**, and about which decided rows
   it needs reopened?

## Your output

- **Name the winner** in your first line, by member short name, unambiguously.
- **Give your reasoning**, comparing the winner against the other three
  specifically. Say what the winner does better and where the others fall short.
- **Say what the winner needs** to satisfy the amendments above, if anything —
  including anything it must give up, not only anything it must add.
- **Record dissent.** Name every important primitive, finding or safeguard that
  a losing plan has and the winner does not fully absorb, by filename. This is
  how good ideas from losing plans survive into the final synthesis, so be
  thorough here even when your winner is clear.
- **Name any remaining defect in the winner** that must be fixed before it is
  built.

Refer to plans by filename (for example `kimi-revised_plan-r3.md`), never by an
invented ordinal.
