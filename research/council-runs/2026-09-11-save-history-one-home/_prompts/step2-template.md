# Council — Step 2: peer review

You are one of five council members. In Step 1 each of you independently judged
the delta to the conflict-resolution plan of record -- one hidden history store for
the earlier versions of a player's saves (the commission, `00-problem-statement.md`). The
complete corpus is embedded above this brief again, unchanged and hash-verified;
the other members' Step 1 analyses are injected below.

Your task is to review **their** analyses. You are not revising your own position
in this step, and you are not voting yet.

## Anti-self-citation constraint

You are critiquing **proposals about this system**, not observations of the
council run that produced them. Do not treat the injected analyses as evidence
about how well councils work, how models behave, or how this deliberation is
going. Reason about the substance on its merits, against the embedded corpus.

## What a good review does here

- **Test claims against the corpus.** Several analyses make specific assertions
  about what the shipped code does, what EmulationStation's helpers do, what
  rclone does, and what a register row decides. The corpus is embedded above.
  Where a claim is checkable, check it, and say plainly whether it holds. A
  confidently wrong claim about rclone's `--backup-dir` overlap rule, the
  allowlist, the shipped set-aside, a register row or what #22 R1-R9 says is the
  most valuable thing you can catch.
- **Separate what is established from what is asserted.** Some claims rest on
  the corpus; some rest on the member's own knowledge of rclone, bisync,
  RetroArch or filesystem behaviour that is *not* in the corpus. The second kind
  may still be right, but it is a hypothesis that needs an experiment. Say which
  is which, including where a member has already labelled their own inference.
- **Identify the strongest and the weakest argument in each analysis**, by name
  and filename.
- **Name failure modes every analysis missed.** Convergence between four models
  is not evidence of correctness; it may be shared blind spots.
- **Give concrete revisions** each proposal should make, specific enough that
  the author could act on them in Step 3.

Where you disagree with another member, argue the substance. Where they have
changed your mind, say so explicitly and why. Do not average positions, and do
not soften a real disagreement into a both-sides summary.

Refer to each analysis by its injected filename (for example `claude-analysis.md`),
never by an invented ordinal such as "Analysis 1" or "the first proposal" —
downstream steps inject your review into other members' prompts, and anonymised
ordinals have caused members to misidentify which position was their own.
